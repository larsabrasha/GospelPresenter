# Gospel Presenter, rewrite

The TypeScript, local-first rewrite decided in `adr/0007-rewrite-on-typescript-local-first.md`,
built from the behaviour spec in `spec/`. It runs beside the current .NET app until it has proved
itself.

Milestone 1 was one song, one presentation, output on a second screen, and sync between two clients,
in Electron with no internet. Milestone 2 makes songs and presentations behave as spec 02 and 03 say:
arrangements, ranked search, the trash, item arrangements, renaming and moving items, and the event
date after create. The output window reads through the operator window's database, so it also works
where OPFS is missing.

| Package | What it is |
|---|---|
| `packages/core` | Schema and its migrations, mutators with Zod-validated arguments, permissions, slides, song search, live pointer |
| `packages/sync` | The sync engine: client (rebase, pokes) and server (push, pull, change log) |
| `apps/server` | Hono server on Node (one SQLite file per organisation) and on Workers (a Durable Object per organisation) |
| `apps/web` | React + Vite client: wa-sqlite on OPFS in a worker |
| `apps/desktop` | Electron: the embedded server, the main window and the output window |

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test   # unit and sync tests, on Node, node:sqlite and local workerd
pnpm e2e                                   # milestones 1 and 2 in Electron, with real windows

pnpm --filter @gp/desktop start            # the desktop app
GP_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:<port> GP_DATA_DIR=/tmp/gp-second pnpm --filter @gp/desktop start
                                           # a second client of the first
pnpm --filter @gp/desktop serve            # the server alone on :8787, then `pnpm --filter @gp/web dev`
```

Needs Node 22 or later and pnpm 12. The e2e opens real windows. `?storage=memory` in the page URL
(`GP_STORAGE=memory` for the desktop app) keeps the database in memory, as where OPFS is missing.

A database records its schema version in `_schema`. One made by an older version (milestone 1 has no
row: version 1) is migrated when it is opened, on the server and on clients; a client then pulls
everything again, because the schema is part of the pull cookie.

## Not done yet

Sign-in (the user comes from the URL, and the server only checks the membership), pairing and the
LAN, Bible, images, themes, templates, English text, mobile, and deploying to Cloudflare. The Workers
adapter is tested in local workerd only.

From spec 02 and 03 in particular: song history (SONG-R20–R24, D9), the labels page, CCLI, ProPresenter
import, the dashboard's Idag/Kommande sections and "last changed" order, event time, place,
description and theme, multi-select removal, the keyboard help dialog, the song editor inside the add
dialog, the clash warning of D18, and drag and drop (moving is by ↑ and ↓ buttons). Song fields
still save when a field loses focus rather than 500 ms after typing.

## Assumptions

Where the spec and ADR 0007 leave a choice open, the conservative one, written down:

- **The output never opens a database.** It always reads through the operator window's worker over a
  BroadcastChannel, with OPFS or without. If no operator window answers, a read waits and is asked
  again every second, and the output keeps showing what it last had.
- **Expired trash is purged when the trash page opens**, for songs too (unifying 02 Q4). The age is
  measured by the earlier of the client's and the server's clock, so a client clock that runs ahead
  never purges early. When something was trashed is the trashing client's clock.
- **"Töm papperskorgen" purges the entries the user saw**, one by one, not whatever the server holds
  by then: something trashed on another device meanwhile stays.
- **Arrangements have an explicit order** (a `sort` column, new ones last); the first is the default
  (02 Q8). Deleting a part removes every occurrence of it from every arrangement (02 Q7).
- **An item whose arrangement was deleted shows all parts** (SONG-R18 as written), not the song's
  first arrangement. Adding with no arrangement picked stores none, so the item follows the song's
  first arrangement, whatever that becomes; an arrangement that is not the song's (deleted
  meanwhile) is dropped rather than refusing the add.
- **A trashed song can still be added on the server**: an add made offline while someone else trashed
  the song keeps the item, which the editor then flags (D17).
- **Chip edits and item moves are relative**: they name the part (or item) and a place, and apply to
  the list as it is where they run, so quick edits in a row and edits from two devices compose. A
  whole-list `updateArrangement` (no UI uses it) is last writer wins.
- **Limits on the server**: 5 000 songs, 50 parts per song, 10 arrangements per song, 100 items per
  presentation (spec 02, 03), and 500 chips per arrangement (the spec limits the JSON to 5 000
  characters instead).
- **The arrangement name field shows only with two or more arrangements** (SONG-A9, as the current
  app does).
- **A purged song's items stay** in their presentations and say the song is gone.
